"""
This program analyzes the logfiles and extracts useful info :-)
It does not work since the main program moved to multi-thread mode.

TODO - Update this program to handle the multithread-logs..
    Some thoughts:
    Loop through the logs and detect the thread that each log is referring to and write it to a different file.
    Keep the names of those files in a list and go through the files and analyze each one of them (each thread-file separately).
    It's more appropriate to create multiple files, each one for each threadm than keepping the logs for each thread in-memory in a multimap.
    There is more storage than memory...
